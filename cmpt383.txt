Porject Summary:

What is the overall goal of the project (i.e. what does it do, or what problem is it solving)?

-> Simple fast calculation. One can easily fire up the SpringBoot app and get instant calculations that they desire.

Which languages did you use, and what parts of the system are implemented in each?

->Java, Javascript, and a very little bit of C. Most of the app logic is written in Java, with data serving by JavaScript, more spepcifically Vue.js. C is just used to create a HelloJNI file that I tried to integrate into the app, but kept resulting into server faults.

What methods did you use to communicate between languages?

-> Communication between Java and C handled by JNI. Tried Swig, failed miserably. Communication between Java and Vue.js handled by using the Rest API and a ton of GET requests. 

Exactly what steps should be taken to get the project working, after getting your code? [This should start with vagrant up and can include one or two commands to start components after that.]

-> Follow the following steps:
vagrant up
cd project/server
mvn spring-boot:run

That simple. As I write this, I'll be testing out deployment once I push to git repo.

What features should we be looking for when marking your project?

->I dunno. Up to you.
